# Unity-FPS
A First Person Shooter built off the unity FPS microgame levels, configurable settings, High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) and more.

edit: there is some un-important code I forgot to get rid of, and i'm too lazy to fix it

edit 2: I just wanted to add that the assets used in the project are not mines.
